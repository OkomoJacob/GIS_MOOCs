## INTRODUCTION
### Course Objectives
- Differentiate between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Given code, alter the position and style of components within a web map app.

## Understanding web pages
Every web page consist of:
- HTML
- CSS
- Scripting Language e.g JS

### Getting started with HTML

## Making web pages dynamic
- You will now learn about using JavaScript to make a web page more interactive. 
- This topic will introduce you to the basics of JavaScript scripting as well as how to get started writing JavaScript code. 
- You will also learn about the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and how to implement a basic web mapping app using it.

### Getting started with JavaScript
Scripting languages primarily run inside web browsers to make web pages dynamic and interactive. There are many scripting languages available that are supported in multiple web browsers. When you create a web page that contains JavaScript, remember that JavaScript behaves differently in different web browsers. Incompatibility differences may exist based on which JavaScript capabilities are supported in each browser.
### Write JavaScript code
In this activity, you will practice writing your first JavaScript code using basic JavaScript functionality. Using the following instructions, construct your JavaScript by dragging the listed code items to their correct position in the unfinished web page.

Your supervisor has assigned you to complete the following JavaScript code to make it work properly. After an initial inspection of the code, you must create a function named myMessage. The myMessage function should be called directly from an onClick event when someone browsing your page clicks the Press Me button. Within the myMessage function, a variable named message is created with a value of My first JavaScript. After the variable is created, display the message variable in the document's demo div element.
### Discovering the ArcGIS API for JavaScript
An application program interface (API) is set of objects and tools used for building applications. APIs exist for building desktop, mobile, and web-based applications. The ArcGIS API for JavaScript is a web API that allows you to script applications that are accessible over the web. Numerous APIs are available for building applications, and you can use multiple APIs to build a single web app. Using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, you can implement GIS and mapping interaction-related functions by writing just a few lines of JavaScript code

Mapping, querying, feature editing, tracking, routing, and geoprocessing tasks are all capabilities or services available to you when using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
